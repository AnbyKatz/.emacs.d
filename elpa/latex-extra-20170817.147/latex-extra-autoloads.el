Set the function used to fill a paragraph to `latex/auto-fill-function'.

(autoload 'latex/setup-keybinds "latex-extra" "\
Obsolete function. Use (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'latex-extra-mode) instead.

\(fn)" t nil)

(autoload 'latex-extra-mode "latex-extra" "\
Defines extra commands and keys for LaTeX-mode.

If called interactively, enable Latex-Extra mode if ARG is positive, and
disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called from Lisp,
also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it
if ARG is `toggle'; disable the mode otherwise.

To activate just call
    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'latex-extra-mode)

The additions of this package fall into the following three
categories:

1-Key Compilation
=================

Tired of hitting C-c C-c 4 times (latex, bibtex, latex, view) for
the document to compile? This defines a much needed command that does
*everything* at once, and even handles compilation errors!

  C-c C-a `latex/compile-commands-until-done'

Navigation
==========

Five new keybindings are defined for navigating between
sections/chapters. These are meant to be intuitive to people familiar
with `org-mode'.

  C-c C-n `latex/next-section'
    Goes forward to the next section-like command in the buffer (part,
    chapter, (sub)section, or (sub)paragraph, whichever comes first).
  C-c C-u `latex/up-section'
    Goes backward to the previous section-like command containing this
    one. For instance, if you're inside a subsection it goes up to the
    section that contains it.
  C-c C-f `latex/next-section-same-level'
    Like next-section, except it skips anything that's \"lower-level\" then
    the current one. For instance, if you're inside a subsection it finds
    the next subsection (or higher), skipping any subsubsections or
    paragraphs.
  C-M-f `latex/forward-environment'
    Skip over the next environment, or exit the current one, whichever
    comes first.
  C-M-e `latex/end-of-environment'
    Exit the current environment, and skip over some whitespace
    afterwards. (Like `LaTeX-find-matching-end', but a little more useful.)

  C-M-b `latex/backward-environment'
  C-M-a `latex/beginning-of-environment'
  C-c C-p `latex/previous-section'
  C-c C-b `latex/previous-section-same-level'
    Same as above, but go backward.

Whitespace Handling
===================

`latex-extra.el' improves `auto-fill-mode' so that it only applies to
text, not equations. To use this improvement, just activate
`auto-fill-mode' as usual.

It also defines a new command:

  C-c C-q `latex/clean-fill-indent-environment'
    Completely cleans up the entire current environment. This involves:

    1. Removing extraneous spaces and blank lines.
    2. Filling text (and only text, not equations).
    3. Indenting everything.
