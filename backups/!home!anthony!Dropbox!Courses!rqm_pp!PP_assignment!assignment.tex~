\section{Question 1}
see crudely stapled paper to the back of this assignment.

\section{Question 2.a}
The quark masses for $u,d,s$ are approximately the same in the limit compared to the baryons and mesons they compose ($m_u\approx m_d$ however $m_s$ has a greater difference between the two).

So we can consider them as a set of three particles only distinguishable by their label $u,d,s$. The strong force gluons don't see electric charge so even though the quarks have different charges, it remains a triplet of similar particles (The EM corrections are $\sim 1\%$ so we can neglect them).

This means there exists a symmetry between states composed with these three quarks which we can represent via the unitary transformation
\begin{align*}
  \m{u\\d\\s}\to U\m{u\\d\\s}
\end{align*}

i.e. We can mix states composed of $u,d$ and $s$ quarks and the resulting possible combinations are different kinds of the same particle up to the amount of $s$ quarks as the mass of $s$ is quite different. An example would be the meson octet which mixes the states $\ket{u\bar{u}},\ket{d\bar{d}}$ and $\ket{s\bar{s}}$.

\section{Question 2.b.i}
When we look at the $\Delta^{++}$ baryon for instance which has angular momentum $J=+\frac{3}{2}$ and in the ground state (quantum number $l=0$). $l=0\implies$ symmetric spatial wave function. The quark content to make this baryon must be $(uuu)$ to make the total charge so it's fully flavour symmetric (composed of all the same quarks).

However $u$ quarks are spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions. By the Pauli exclusion principle we cannot have 2 fermions together with the same spin. We only have spin $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ for possible spins but we have 3 particles so 2 particles must have the same spin. So it should be impossible for a $(uuu)$ particle to exist but it does.

So we invent a new set of quantum numbers and call them colour. This gives us what is called $SU(3)$ colour symmetry in which we assign to every quark a colour or anti-colour (red, green, blue). If the total colour sums to white then the bound quark state is allowed.

This allows for the existence of the $\Delta^{++}$ baryon as it is colour neutral and all the quantum numbers of the particles aren't the same anymore.

\section{Question 2.b.ii}

The asymptotic freedom of the strong force ($SU(3)$ colour interactions) refers to the fact that the strong force gets asymptotically weaker at shorter distances/higher momentum transfers ($Q=-q$ where $q$ is the momentum transfer). When $Q$ is large, the coupling strength of the strong force is low which allows for us to only take lower order terms in a perturbative expansion.

The colour interactions become negligible and the electromagnetic force dominates. If the strong force is approximated as an exchange of pions, at high energies/short distances we can consider these exchanges of pions to be negligible.

\section{Question 2.b.iii}

A current quark refers to just the bare quark propagator through a true vacuum. However we know this is unrealistic so we refer to the constituent quark which is the current quark propagator dressed with gluon couplings and quark-antiquark loops interacting with the propagator. These gluons are self interacting and cause constant field fluctuations.

These constant gluon interactions or gluon dressing contribute to the effective mass. So in a sense this dressing dynamically creates mass which increases the mass of the bare quark propagator.

The current quark has only a small amount of mass compared to the constituent quark for the $u,d,s$ quarks so most the mass for these quarks comes from dynamically mass generation from gluon interactions.

The key reason why this occurs is that gluons carry colour themselves and we know that they interact with any coloured object. Our $SU(3)$ colour symmetry has assigned a colour to all quarks and in doing so has allowed them to interact with gluons. This allows for the gluon dressing of a quark propagator to occur and the end result is constant gluon self interacting and couplings to the coloured object i.e. the quark.

It is these couplings that dynamically create mass. Your mass does not come from the Higgs as two men named Derek once said.

\section{Question 3.a}
see crudely stapled paper to the back of this assignment... again

\section{Question 3.b}

We have mesons
\begin{align*}
  K^0=(\bar{s}d) \qquad \bar{K}^0=\qty(s\bar{d})
\end{align*}
Charge conjugation sends quarks to their anti-quarks so hence
\begin{align*}
  C\ket{K^0}=C\ket{\bar{s}d}=\ket{s\bar{d}}=\ket{\bar{K}^0}
\end{align*}
and similarly
\begin{align*}
  C\ket{\bar{K}^0}=\ket{K^0}
\end{align*}
The parity operator assigns a value of $+1$ for every particle and $-1$ for every anti-particle (this is done multiplicativly. Hence we have that
\begin{align*}
  P\ket{K^0}=P\ket{\bar{s}d}=(-1)(+1)\ket{\bar{s}d}=-\ket{K^0}
\end{align*}
similarly we have that
\begin{align*}
  P\ket{\bar{K}^0}=-\ket{\bar{K}^0}
\end{align*}

\section{Question 3.c}

Using the knowledge of the eigen-values from the previous question we can construct eigen states of $\ket{K^0}$ and $\ket{\bar{K}^0}$ which are just linear combinations of each other with an overall normalisation.

\begin{align*}
  \ket{K_1}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(\ket{K^0}-\ket{\bar{K}^0})\\
  \ket{K_2}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(\ket{K^0}+\ket{\bar{K}^0})
\end{align*}

Let's check if their eigen states of the $CP$ operator with some eigenvalues.

\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{K_1}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(CP\ket{K^0}-CP\ket{\bar{K}^0})\\
             &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(-\ket{\bar{K}^0}+\ket{K^0})\\
             &=(+1)\ket{K_1}
\end{align*}

and

\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{K_2}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(CP\ket{K^0}+CP\ket{\bar{K}^0})\\
             &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(-\ket{\bar{K}^0}-\ket{K^0})\\
             &=(-1)\ket{K_2}  
\end{align*}

Hence these are both eigen states of the $CP$ operator with eigen-value $\pm 1$.

\section{Question 3.d}

\begin{align*}
  \pi^0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(u\bar{u}-d\bar{d})
\end{align*}
we have that
\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{\pi^0}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(CP\ket{u\bar{u}}-CP\ket{d\bar{d}})\\
               &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(-C\ket{u\bar{u}}+C\ket{d\bar{d}})\\
               &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(-\ket{u\bar{u}}+\ket{d\bar{d}})\\
               &=-\ket{\pi^0}
\end{align*}
Using that $\ket{\pi^0}\otimes\ket{\pi^0}=\ket{\pi^0 \pi^0}$ as they are $\in L^2(\mathbb{C},m)$ with the Lebesgue measure $m$ (elements of an inner product space so the tensor product is well defined).

The parity operator will take $\vb{r}\to-\vb{r}$ for the spatial components. This will also give us the total angular momentum factor  $P\ket{l}\sim (-1)^l\ket{l}$ where $l$ is the angular momentum between the particles (assuming the particles are distinguishable). This comes from the spatial wave function.

If the particles aren't distinguishable then flipping the spatial vector $\vb{r}$ between them doesn't give us this factor as the particles essentially look like they're still in the same positions.

the $C$ operator will also have a factor of $(-1)^l$ for particles that are not their own anti-particle and not for ones that are via the same argument as above. When we swap particles for their anti-particle it reverses the direction but only if we can tell the difference between the particle and anti-particle. 

\begin{align*}
  \implies \ CP\ket{\pi^0\pi^0 l}&=(-1)(-1)\ket{\pi^0\pi^0 l}\\
                                 &=\ket{\pi^0\pi^0 l}
\end{align*}
so $\ket{\pi^0\pi^0 l}$ is an eigen-state of the $CP$ operator with eigenvalue $+1$.

Using the same process for the other state we get that
\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{\pi^+}&=CP\ket{u\bar{d}}\\
               &=-C\ket{u\bar{d}}\\
               &=-\ket{\bar{u}d}\\
               &=-\ket{\pi^{-}}\\
  CP\ket{\pi^-}&=CP\ket{\bar{u}d}\\
               &=-C\ket{\bar{u}d}\\
               &=-\ket{u\bar{d}}\\
               &=-\ket{\pi^+}
\end{align*}
here since the particles are not their own anti-particle and are distinguishable we get factors $(-1)^l$ for both $C$ and $P$ operators hence
\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{\pi^+\pi^-l}&=(-1)(-1)(-1)^l(-1)^l\ket{\pi^-\pi^+l}\\
                     &=(-1)^{2l}\ket{\pi^+\pi^-l}\\
                     &= \ket{\pi^+\pi^-l}
\end{align*}
as this is the same state of the two pion's together with angular momentum between them of $l$ and $l\in\mathbb{Z}$. So the state $\ket{\pi^+\pi^-l}$ is an eigen-state of the $CP$ operator with eigenvalue $+1$ as well.

\section{Question 3.e}

Using our previous knowledge of the $CP$ eigen-values we get that (Where to make it easier, we can consider these states constructed in the following way)
\begin{align*}
  \ket{\pi\pi\pi l_1l_2}=\ket{\pi\pi l_1}\otimes\ket{\pi\pi l_2}
\end{align*}
hence
\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0l_1l_2}&=(-1)(-1)(-1)\\
                               &\phantom{=}\times(-1)^{l_2}\ket{\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0l_1l_2}\\
                               &=(-1)^{l_2+1}\ket{\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0l_1l_2}
\end{align*}
so $\ket{\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0l_1l_2}$ is an eigen-state of $CP$ with eigen-value $(-1)^{l_2+1}$.

\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0l_1l_2}&=(-1)(-1)(-1)\\
  &\phantom{=}\times(-1)^{l_1}(-1)^{l_2}(-1)^{l_1}\ket{\pi^-\pi^+\pi^0l_1l_2}\\
                               &=(-1)^{2l_1+l_2+1}\ket{\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0l_1l_2}\\
                               &=(-1)^{l_2+1}\ket{\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0l_1l_2}
\end{align*}
Where a second factor of $(-1)^{l_2}$ does not come in as this is the angular momentum between $(\pi^+\pi^-)$ and $(\pi^0)$. So the $C$ operator on this combination does not pick up this factor. $\ket{\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0l_1l_2}$ is an eigen-state of the $CP$ operator with eigen-value $(-1)^{l_2+1}$.

If the original particle had spin-0 then by conservation of angular momentum, the total angular momentum of the final 3 particles must be 0 as well. Hence we have that
\begin{align*}
  l_1+l_2=J=0
\end{align*}
using the quantum number relation that if $J=0\implies j=0$ and that
\begin{align*}
  \abs{l_1-l_2}\leq j\leq l_1+l_2
\end{align*}

\section{Question 3.f}

if we let $l_1=l_2=0$ then both $CP$ eigen-states have eigen-value

\begin{align*}
  \text{e-value for both} = (-1)^{l_1+l_2+1}=(-1)
\end{align*}

So both states have $CP$ eigen-value $-1$.

\section{Question 3.g}

The first eigen-state is composed of only $\pi^0$'s which decay via the electromagnetic force through $\pi^0\to\gamma+\gamma$. It may not decay into a lepton and lepton neutrino pair as this would violate charge conservation.

The second state also has $\pi^\pm$ which may decay via the weak force through $\pi^+\to\mu^++\nu_\mu$ and $\pi^-\to\mu^-+\bar{\nu}_\mu$. The coupling strength of the weak interaction is much smaller then the coupling strength of the electromagnetic force.

Hence the first eigen-state which decays via the electromagnetic force has a much shorter life-time then the second eigenstate.

\section{Question 3.h}

Suppose we had two states
\begin{align*}
  \ket{K_1}=\ket{\pi\pi} \qquad \ket{K_2}=\ket{\pi\pi\pi}
\end{align*}
where in the first state we have $\pi^0\pi^0$ or $\pi^+\pi^-$ as our particles. Both compositions will produce a state with $CP$ eigen-value +1 which we have seen from part one.

The second state may have $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0$ or $\pi^0\pi^-\pi^+$ as our particles. Both compositions will produce a state with $CP$ eigen-value -1 which we have seen from part one.

With these $CP$ eigen-states, we may now construct $K_L$ as a linear combination of these $CP$ eigen-states so it too will be a $CP$ eigen-state.

\begin{align*}
  \ket{K_L}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\abs{\epsilon}^2}}\qty(\ket{K_2}+\epsilon\ket{K_1})
\end{align*}

Due to the difference in the mean life times of the eigen-states, a long lived $K_L$ still contains a small amount of the $K_1$ eigen-state. If $CP$ was conserved, we would expect that this eigen-state would in the beginning have a $CP$ eigen-value of (suppose $\epsilon=1$ initially)

\begin{align*}
  CP\ket{K_L}\sim (+1-1)=0
\end{align*}

After a long experiment time you would expect the eigen-state $\ket{K_L}$ to only be composed of the $K_2$ so it should have a $CP$ eigen-value of -1. However we measure that the beam still has a small amount of the $K_1$ eigen-state, hence $CP$ is violated.
