\section{Introduction}
In recent years we have seen exponential increase in the field of robotics and autonomous machinery. Robots are more capable of performing fine motor movement with each passing year such as opening doors, navigating stairs and even back flips. Taking this to the logical end point, when the machines eventually try to lobotomize the human race, one might ask the question ``What is the effect of High energy particles on complex machinery designed to mimic the human anatomy''? In this report we hope to explore this exact question and others such as

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the cut off energy to conceivably short circuit/kill an android?
\item which energies consistently produce this cut off energy? (Higher energies cause the production of more secondary particles which also contribute to the energy deposition)
\item When factoring in the energy deposited per particle of a given energy, probability of successful collisions and economic costs of the production of these particles. Which is the most economically viable energy for the particles?
\item Why... did i even choose this topic
\end{itemize}

In short, we are testing what kind of particles we need in certain energy ranges to deposit sufficient energy to destroy modern day electronics/robotics. We will be approximating the chemical composition of future machinery to current machinery and testing against known values of currents/energies deposited that cause machinery to fail. The skeletal shape of the robots also plays an important factor as the primary surface area for destruction will be the robots chest and head (Where most the vital components are stored) as opposed to the same test on just a computer which we could approximate to a cube where the entire cube is the surface area of destruction.

This report will be made up of the following sections: ``\textbf{The Problem}'' where we will be discussing the physics, approximations and relevance (if any) of what we are studying. ``\textbf{Method}'' How Geant4 can be used to simulate our conundrum and acquire relevant data. ``\textbf{Description}'' The step by step process of how the simulation was undertaken inside Geant4 and what occurred. ``\textbf{Results and Conclusion}'' self explanatory.

Introductions over, time to annihilate robots of all possible genders \footnote{We're actually only considering the male Geant4 human phantom unfortunately}.

\newpage
\section{The Problem}
\subsection{Background Physics}

Energized particles do damage to electronics via ionization . The amount of damage is heavily dependent on the distance from target to source, energy of the particle, number of particles and the composition of material being penetrated \cite{thesis}. For instance, if the robots where wearing a protective layer of lead of about a few cm's thick then we would need much higher energy particles to penetrate this barrier due to leads high attenuation attributed to it's high density. For this project however we will make the assumption that this is not the case based on the fact that due to leads high density, a protective coating of lead would weigh a considerable amount and restrict the robots movement as to allow us to batter them with sticks or some other pointy objects.

We may also assume nothing lies in the path of us and the target i.e the density of the medium between source and target will be negligible. So to summarize: we will consider a beam of energized particles towards a target at a distance of a few metres away in a low density medium (i.e air). The attenuation considered will come solely from the composition of the robot and no other external sources.

Consider the case of gamma ray's which have an energy ranging from $\approx$100KeV to as high as 10TeV interacting with the electrical components \cite{wikipedia}. Gamma-ray photons deposit their energy via ionization where the bulk of this damage comes from the enhancement of conductivity via the creation of extra charge carriers and trapped charge \cite{radiation}. These photons interact in the following ways \cite{matter}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Photoelectric effect
\item Compton effect
\item Electron-positron pair production
\end{itemize}
The later two process's occur for high-energy photons which will be the case we will consider. These effects cause the conductivity of the material to be enhanced  \cite{thesis}. In silicon based compounds which is a primary chemical is processing chips \cite{chips}, the energy needed to create an electron positron pair is given in Table \ref{table:1}:

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|r|c|l|}
      \hline
      Material & $E_{ion}$[eV] \\
      \hline \hline
      Silicon & 3.6\\ 
      Silicon Dioxide & 18 \\
      \hline
      
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The ionisation energy of silicon and silica \cite{silicon}}
    \label{table:1}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

We will assume that the vital components of the robots are comprised of silicon based compounds similar to modern processing chips. Without going into the nitty gritty detail, these effects all contribute to the failure of electrical components. Where all these are caused from high energy photons depositing their energy, which is the main statistic we will be sampling i.e. the energy deposited and where.

The minimum energy required to cause damage to the electrical components is 10MeV (this figure is based on the energies of particles in the Van Allen belts which cause issues for satellites \cite{radiation}). We will take the approximate of 10MeV and claim this as our damage cut off based on the fact that the energy required to make electron positron pairs is only 3.6eV in our silicon processors (i.e when 10MeV is deposited into the material we will consider it destroyed). Taking this into account we wish to calculate two things, the minimum energy required for the particle to deposit the cut off energy into the robots vulnerable areas and the percentage of particles that successfully deposit their energy into the robots vulnerable bits per $n$ particles in a range of energies.

It is important to note that we will be factoring in spread of the particle beam into our study i.e the particle beam will not consistently hit our desired target in every trial. This gives each particle of a given energy a probability of successful deposition which we will discuss in more detail in section 3 but it is worth noting that this will cause greater noise in our data.

\subsection{Robot Composition and Construction}
Due to the primary area of surface destruction being the head and chest, we will assume that all vital electrical components will be contained under the rib cage as this allows for the most defence against radiation. We will keep two lungs as targets for our particle beams and remove all other organs (expect the testicles which must stay).

The remaining organs (the lungs) will act as our primary target i.e when 10MeV is deposited cumulatively into either lung we will consider this robot obliterated. There is a case to be made that the head which will contain all the robots visual sensory information is also of importance for extermination (assuming that future robots are still narcissistically made in our image). However we may assume that at best this will cripple the robots visual feeds so we will stick to extermination.

The robots will be composed of two materials, one for the skeleton and one for the head, trunk and organs/gizmos. The skeleton was chosen to be composed of grade 5 titanium alloy which contains 6\% aluminum, 4\% vanadium, 0.25\% iron, 0.2\% oxygen and the remainder being titanium with a density of 4.43*g/cm3. This is the most commonly used titanium alloy and boasts adequate strength for our purposes  \cite{titanium}. The rest will be composed of stainless steel 316 which contains 12\% Nickel, 17\% Chromium, 2.5\% Molybdenum, 1\% silicon, 2\% Manganese, 0.08\% Copper, 0.045\% Phosphorus, 0.03\% Sulfur with the remainder being iron with a density of 8.03*g/cm3 \cite{steel}.

\subsection{Results Applications}
Whilst the original goal of this report was for the own creators amusement we may extrapolate its results to apply for modern day robotics. For instance with the advance of technology it is highly likely that more complex machinery will be used to survey outer planets such as mars which has a thinner atmosphere. Understanding how high energy particles interact with electronics will be vital in damage prevention and maintenance of the machinery. Particularly prevention in the case of planetary expeditions where maintenance will not be an option. One must also consider that during the journey to for instance Mars, the absence of an atmosphere will pose problems for on board electronics. Essentially we can extend the results of this analysis to any case where electronics are being used in the absence of protection (i.e. an atmosphere).

\newpage
\section{Method}
Geant4 already contains a majority of the physics processes we will be testing for (production of secondary particles from collisions, sensor/detector that records the energy deposition and relevant particle dynamics i.e Compton scattering etc.).

\subsection{Robot Creation}
For our project we will be editing the pre-existing Geant4 example human phantom to meet our specified parameters for a generic robot and using Geant4's inbuilt beam function to fire high energy particles at our target. Firstly we must add the new elements our robots are composed of to the file ``G4HumanPhantomMaterial.cc'' which contains an element list plus the compositions of human skin, skeletal system, organs etc. Below is an example of defining the element Aluminum:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=12cm,height=1.5cm]{Image_1}
    \caption{Declaration of Aluminum}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

where $Z$ is the atomic number and $A$ the molar mass. Following this process we include elements such as Titanium, Cobalt, Nickel and other various metals where their values for atomic number and molar mass come from the periodic table \cite{periodic}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=8cm,height=7cm]{Image_2}
    \caption{Declaration of Titanium Alloy and stainless steel}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Next we construct the titanium alloy and stainless steel compounds using the Geant4 function ``G4Material'' shown above.  Where in this declaration $d$ is the density and the element is defined under the following syntax:

\numblock{G4Material(Name, density value, Number of elements)}

Next we go into the file ``G4HumanPhantomConstruction.cc'' and comment out the construction of all organs expect the lungs (and testicles). Similarly we comment out setting the detectors sensitivity for these removed organs.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,height=.3\textwidth]{Image_4} 
  \caption{Commented out construction}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.25\textwidth]{Image_5} 
  \caption{Commented out detector sensitivity}
\end{figure}

This produces our test subject the T-2000 robot eviscerator. From here we will simply manually change the energy of the particle beam inside Geant4's GUI and fire the particles at our recipient. The beam is already set to gamma ray production and incorporates electron positron pair production.

Finally we add some lines of code in our main function to ensure our experiment is sufficiently random, namely in the file ``phantom.cc'' we add

\numblock{\text{CLHEP::HepRandom::setTheEngine(new CLHEP::RanecuEngine);}\\
 \text{G4long seed=time(0);}\\
 CLHEP::HepRandom::setTheSeed(seed);\\}

\subsection{Data Collection Methods}
There are a few ways we could collect data and reach a conclusion for this experiment but we will just cover the following methods. We want to calculate the minimum energy of the particle beam required to deposit the cut off energy for one particle which is not 10MeV as one might naively think due to the protection/attenuation of the rib cage.

To do this We want two pieces of information: The probability for a particle of a certain energy to deposit its energy into the lungs and the total energy deposited into the lungs over $n$ trials. To calculate the probability we run $n$ trials and record the total number of hits $n_0$ and hence the probability of collision for a particle of that energy is $P_0=n_0/n$. To calculate the average energy we employ the following formula:

\[E_{\text{avg}}=\frac{1}{P_0n}\sum_i E_i  \]

where we sum over all energies recorded but we account for the fact that not every trial produces a successful collision. We then plot the average energies deposited for a range of fired particle energies to ascertain the minimum energy needed for cut off.

It is worth noting the relationship between the energy per particle and the number of particles required to reach the cut off as we wish to draw a conclusion about economic viability of the following two approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Higher particle number, lower energy per particle
\item Lower particle number, Higher energy per particle
\end{itemize}
where the complications come from the inaccuracy of the particle beam. This is of importance to us due to the fact that lower energy particles are easier to produce so we wish to strike a balance between economic viability and efficiency of destruction \cite{particle}.

A higher particle number beam has a lower probability of depositing all its energy into a medium then a lower particle number beam. This can be mathematically represented quite easily: suppose we consider the case where we want to deposit energy $E$ for $n$ particles. if the probability of a particle depositing it's energy is $P$ then the total probability of all particles depositing their energies is
\[P_{\text{T}}=P^n\]
where $0<P<1$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$ (assuming that each particle has the same probability to depose its energy)\footnote{It should be noted that higher energy particles will have a higher probability of hitting the target due to a larger production of secondary particles which also contribute to a potential collision with the critical area.}. The figure below shows a diagrammatic representation of this for the listed probabilities. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=.5\textwidth]{Image_6}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Probability vs Number of Particles}
\end{figure}

hence unless our probability of collision with the desired target is $\geq.95$ then firing large numbers of particles is wasteful. Due to the shielding produced by the robots rib cage which vastly lowers the probability of deposition in the critical area hence we will only consider lower numbers of particles being fired.

With this in mind we produce another plot that shows the minimum number of particles needed to produce the cutoff energy or a range of energies. This is easily calculated from the following:
\[E_{min}=10MeV  \]
and we want
\[N\cdot E_p=E_{min}\implies E_p=\frac{E_{min}}{N}\]
where $N$ is the number of particles and $E_p$ is the energy per particle. Using the above formula for a range of values of $N$ gives us the following. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=.5\textwidth]{Image_7}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Minimum Number of Particles for a given energy to achieve cutoff}
\end{figure}
We will refer back to this plot later when we account for the higher probability of collision for higher energy particles. Ultimately we want to optimize for minimum energy per particle whilst factoring in the fluctuating probabilities that comes with changing the total number of fired particles.

\section{Description}
We begin by building our edited human phantom model in a directory of our choosing under the usual commands

\numblock{cmake -DCMAKE\_PREFIX\_PATH=\\$\sim$/Documents/geant4/geant4.10.04.p01-install\\
 $\sim$/Documents/geant4/examples/robot}

This creates the necessary build files and then we simply type

\numblock{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad make -j4}

to build our robot. Running our robot with the command $"./\text{phantom}"$ brings up the visualization and lets us see our overlord in all his glory.
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.25\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth,height=.5\textwidth]{Image_3}
  \caption{Machine Overlord}
\end{wrapfigure}
We now want to alter the inbuilt beam function to fire high energy particles at our newly constructed target and record the energy deposited. This process of altering the beams energy will be continued until we reach the minimum energy required to deposit the cut off energy of destruction which was recorded as 10MeV from our previous sources (note that this will be carried out with only one particle in the particle beam, more on this below).

To alter the beams energy we input the following command into the GUI

\numblock{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad /gps/energy <Energy> <Unit>}

where units may be eV, MeV, GeV etc. After the beam energy is altered we then run the beam using

\numblock{\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad /run/beamOn <nParticles>}

where nParticles=number of particles. This command will run our beam, output a list of organs with the energy deposition in each and produce a plot of the collision/collisions like so:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,height=.4\textwidth]{Image_8}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Deposition of particle beam of energy 5GeV}
\end{figure}  

where the above simulation was run at 5GeV for one particle\footnote{We will soon see why we have run the simulation at such high energy despite the cut off energy only being 10MeV.}. We use the above command for one particle until we find the approximate minimum energy needed to produce the cut off energy, call it $E_{min}$. Next we take a range of energies around $E_{min}$ and test the probability of energy deposition in the critical area by taking 50 trials and counting the number of successful trials. Combining the knowledge of the probability of successful energy deposition in the critical area for a given range of energies with our plots from section 3.2 which tells us the approximate amount of particles we will need to reach cut off, we may then make a conclusion about which energy would be the most economically viable.

\subsection{Discussion}

Running the commands as specified above where we used a sample of 100 particles to calculate the probability of successful collision for a given energy and a sample of 1000 particles for the average energy, we found that firstly: The probability of successful energy deposition into the lungs was extremely low, even for energies as high as 5GeV. This can be seen in Figure 9 and Table 2 as shown above \footnote{GUI pictures such as Figure 8 are not included as they all look the same as Figure 8}.   

What can be deduced from the graph is that the probability of energy deposition in the target area is directly proportional to the energy of the input particle as we can see that as the energy rises so does the probability. The probabilities however still remain below 20\% even for energies as high as 5GeV. Hence we can extrapolate that our particle beam is extremely inefficient, unless we raise the energy to economically unviable energies. These high energies would require large particle accelerators to obtain which isn't exactly a compact portable device i.e. the kind we would want for mobile use to destroy robots on the go. Based on these results we also rule out firing any number of particles less then 10 as our graph above demonstrates that the chance of successful deposition for a particle beam of particle number lower then 10 is statistically improbable under repeated trials.

We could alter the code to produce particle beams that are 100\% accurate but we stipulate that this would be an unphysical approximation as in a post apocalyptic setting the robots will not simply stay stationary to be fired upon hence we claim this inaccuracy of the particle beam to be vital to the simulation. This however does lead to the unfortunate result of highly inaccurate particle beams when fired at a distance from the target.

Now looking at the average energy deposited per particle, clearly from the Figure 10 and Table 3 we can see that on average the energy deposited per particle of a given energy is below half of the particles original energy. Most of this energy is lost to attenuation from the robots rib cage and trunk. This again suggests that our particle beam is inefficient as we lose more then half the energy we must create. Remembering that the minimum energy for cut off was 10MeV, it can be seen that the lowest energy particle that on average produces this cut off energy is 2GeV (the 400MeV case is most likely an outlier based on the surrounding energies).

Comparing this data with our plots from section 3.2 tells us a few things, namely consider two situations. One where we are a great distance from the target and would prefer a lower particle number and higher energy per particle (i.e. a sniping situation) and the other case where we are close to the target and accuracy/probability with the target area is of less concern. Our data gives us the best energy and particle numbers for both the situations.

In the first case the beam of particles of energy 2GeV where every particle on average will carry the necessary energy for extermination will be the most efficient based on the data as we wish for every particle to be a potential killer. This is due to the fact that at large distances the particle beam will have greater spread so we must account for the cases where very minimal amounts of particles hit our desired location. Hence by ensuring that every particle carries sufficient energy to kill the robot, we ensure that even if only one particle hits the target area, the robot will still be destroyed.

In the second case, we can see that a if we fire a beam of 4 particles of energy 50MeV. This on average will also destroy the robot and will be the most economically viable for this situation because of the fact that are shorter distances, we may aim directly for the rib cage, thus increasing the probability of successful collisions. With this collision probability increased and by looking at our plot from 3.2, we can see that if we have a probability of lets say .9 for successful collisions. We will still have a reasonable chance of depositing the required energy necessary to kill said robots. So factoring this in and remembering that lower energy particles are easier to produce lets us come to the conclusion that this energy and particle number will be the best choice for this situation.

\section{Conclusion}

This report has shown the affects of high energy particles on two standard commercial metal alloys and the energies necessary to destroy modern electronics in-cased in said materials. We accounted for the spread of particles, probability of deposition, ranges of energies and the economic viability of certain energies and particle numbers . We packaged this in a amusing scenario of annihilating robots but its results may be extended to general electronics in-cased in metallic containers. 

Our study has shown for two possible situations the most economically viable energies and particle numbers. Namely the long distance and short distance from target situations. The data however does suggest that this method is unfortunately inefficient, this is concluded from two facts: namely the low probability of deposition, and the reduction of total deposited energy due to the attenuation present. The author must hence conclude unfortunately that high energy particles are not a viable method for killing robots in our current model.

Potential improvement's on the study include: sampling more data i.e. more energy ranges and fired particles (this will require more raw computational power). Allowing for a more accurate particle beam or giving the particle beam a consistent vector in a smaller spread around our target area. Including the robots head as a primary target as this will increase the total number of targets (in this case we could make the brain the target similar to the lungs).
