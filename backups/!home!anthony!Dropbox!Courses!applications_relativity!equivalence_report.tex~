\section*{Weak Equivalence principle}

The weak equivalence principle or universality of free fall may be stated in number of ways which are all equivalent. We will consider two such ways to describe this principle: one will encapsulate all necessary information and will be a rather complex statement .The other definition we will dilute down to a Newtonian description as to allow for greater physical understanding.

Assume falling bodies are bound only by non-gravitational forces. Then we have that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The trajectory of a point mass within a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity and not any underlying structure of the particle itself
\item All laws of motion for free falling particles are the same when in an unaccelerated frame of reference
\end{itemize}
Essentially what we are saying is that given an external gravitational field and two distinguishable test bodies. These test bodies must fall with exactly the same acceleration as each other. Gravitational forces seemingly don't care about the composition/structure of the particles themselves.

Mathematically this can be described in the following way: Using the definition of active and passive gravitational masses. Consider a gravitational field caused by $M_0$ in which $M_1$ and $M_2$. The gravitational force on either object due to $M_0$ may be written as
\begin{align*}
  F_i=\frac{M_0^{\text{act}}M_i^{\text{pass}}}{r^2} \qquad i=1,2
\end{align*}

following the proof in \cite{wiki} we find the relation that

\begin{align*}
  \frac{M_0^{\text{act}}}{M_0^{\text{pass}}}=  \frac{M_1^{\text{act}}}{M_1^{\text{pass}}}
\end{align*}

This states that the passive gravitational mass must be proportional to the active gravitational mass for any other object.





\section*{Strong Equivalence principle}

The strong equivalence principle is similar to the weak equivalence principle but is more concerned with differing frames of reference. Like the weak equivalence principle it can also be stated in a number of ways and again we will list two possible descriptions for similar reasons as above. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on it's initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not its underlying structure/composition. We also have that the outcome of any local experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the laboratory and its location in spacetime
  \item The laws of nature are the same in a uniform static gravitational field and its' equivalent accelerated frame of reference
\end{itemize}

The first part of the first bullet point is essentially a version of the weak equivalence principle applied to objects that exert gravitational forces on themselves (Stars, planets etc.). It is worth noting that the freely falling laboratory must be small as to remove tidal forces from the equation. This is the reason we carefully defined the equivalence principle in terms of a local experiment.

A result of this equivalence principle is the following: We cannot tell the difference between an accelerated inertial frame and a stationary frame under the effects of a gravitational force. Or put in another way, gravity looks like an accelerated frame.

The famous example/thought experiment goes like this. Suppose we were standing in a small elevator. When the elevator begins to move upwards, we are incapable of telling whether this elevator is truly moving upwards through spacetime or gravity has merely gotten stronger. The force on this inertial frame is indistinguishable from the frame accelerating itself.

This principle is deeply tied with the fact that we have made no extra assumptions on gravity as a force or the nature of the acceleration it causes itself. We now relate this to Occam's razor in the following section.

\section*{Relation to Occam's Razor}

Occam's razor can be stated in the following way
\begin{itemize}
\item When presented with competing hypothetical answers to a problem, the answer which requires the least assumptions is the one worth considering 
\end{itemize}

This is essentially saying that the fewer assumptions we make, the more likely our model is correct in general when compared to competing theories that assume more.

Consider first inertial reference frames. A fundamental postulate of physics is that the laws of physics don't care about the frame of reference we currently reside in i.e. there is no preference of frame.

Now consider the strong equivalence principle which tells us that we cannot tell the difference between the effects of gravity on a frame and the frame accelerating itself. This is tied deeply with Occam's razor if we consider the following.

When we measure the effects of gravity we measure the acceleration it causes on objects i.e. an apple falling in our frame of reference on the earth. If we consider the elevator example again: suppose we were unaffected by gravity and we had an apple floating inside an elevator. When the elevator beings to move upwards, locally we only see the apple move in the opposite direction to the elevators motion and hence slam into the floor.

An outside observer might be able to tell us that we were moving upwards but locally it looks like the apple has just accelerated downwards by some outside force. So what we measure in both cases (the apple falling to earth or the apple accelerating inside the elevator) is simply an acceleration and we don't see any significant difference between these two kinds of acceleration.

If we phrase this in terms of Occam's razor, we are essentially saying that we don't assume that the acceleration caused by gravity is any different from the acceleration caused by an accelerated frame. The removal of this assumption of distinguishable accelerations leads to the strong equivalence principle itself.

As if we don't assume that any
