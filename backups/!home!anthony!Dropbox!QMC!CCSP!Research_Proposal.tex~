\section{Project title}

Calculating the moment of inertia for neutron stars in the Quantum Meson Coupling Model (QMC).

\section{Project summary}

We wish to calculate the moment of inertia for neutron stars which is an important bulk property. This quantity gives insight into the rotational properties of the star and further contributes to understanding the dynamics of these astrophysical objects.

We will be making use of the QMC model in order to model the neutron star system, allowing us to extract vital quantities such as the equation of state in order to calculate the moment of inertia.

\section{Project details}
\subsection{Introductory background/Literature review}

To begin we need to understand the QMC model, we will be considering the model as discussed in REF. \cite{Guichon:1995ue} and REF. \cite{RikovskaStone:2006ta}.

QMC is an example of a relativistic mean field theory (RMF) in which we take certain approximations about the average energy levels in order to produce solvable equations.

We consider the nucleus of (for example) a proton as a bag containing three quarks which each interact with mesons. These quarks are confined to this bag and the purpose of the model is to allow us to calculate the energy of said mesons, the effective mass of the proton and other properties of the nucleons (protons and neutrons).

The model can also be extended as in REF. \cite{RikovskaStone:2006ta} to include other general types of Baryons including Hyperons which are all particles that have been theorized to exist in neutron stars hence contributing to their mass.

It is these properties calculated from the nucleons that allow us to eventually calculate the equation of state (Pressure versus the energy density). This is then paired with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation which is an equation from REF. \cite{PhysRev.55.374} that allows us to calculate the mass of neutron stars in terms of their radius. 

Finally we can use all these quantities to calculate the moment of inertia of neutron stars. Currently the moment of inertia for neutron stars has not been calculated in the QMC model but the general process will be similar to REF. \cite{Qian:2018qhh}.

\subsection{Research questions}

How may we calculate the moment of inertia for neutron stars in the QMC model? This will be the main gap in the literature that we wish to address. Some other questions we may explore after the calculation is completed is.

How does the equation of state influence the moment of inertia? We will consider the equation of state in the simple case for non-strange baryonic matter but we may also consider equations of state that include Hyperons and the isovector.

The equation of state for the QMC model with the inclusion of these complex mechanisms will be provided by other research students. The main topic of this research is to merely calculate the moment of inertia.

A possible extra research question may be analyze the constraints on the equation of state produced by the gravitational wave experiment seen in REF. \cite{PhysRevLett.119.161101} which hence constrains the moment of inertia through the equation of state.

\subsection{Aims/Objectives of the project}

Our main goal as previously stated is to calculate the moment of inertia of neutron stars by utilizing the QMC model in conjunction with the TOV equation and the equation of state.

The code that runs these calculations can then later be utilized to calculate the moment of inertia in the case of added complexity in the QMC model (such as the addition isovector meson i.e. another particle that interacts in unique ways).

\subsection{Theoretical framework and methods}

We will utilize the QMC model to mathematically derive the necessary formulas to solve for the bulk properties of neutron stars. The QMC models features are based on the MIT bag model found in REF. \cite{THOMAS198469}. We will be dealing with the model that was extended to finite nuclei in REF. \cite{Guichon:1995ue}.

Using this framework gives us a set of equations that we intend to solve numerically for the bulk properties of the neutron star.

Numerical approaches will make up the majority of the calculations where we will utilize such routines as Newton-Raphson's method REF. \cite{MR0053389}, minimization and numerical integration REF. \cite{stoer_bulirsch_bartels_gautschi_witzgall_2010} in order to solve the relevant theoretical equations produced from the QMC model.

This will be achieved via original FORTRAN 95 code written by the author with libraries for routines used where necessary (e.g. for numerical integration).


\subsection{Significance/Contribution to the discipline}

Clearly our main contribution will be that of the calculated moment of inertia for a number of equation of states via the QMC model.

This project will aim to add to the list of properties for neutron stars calculated via the QMC model. In doing so we hope to increase the range of physical quantities for neutron stars that may be calculated via QMC, further extending the models range of description of these highly important astrophysical objects.

This give further insight into these astrophysical objects and extend our physical intuition. The resulting calculations will also be of significance to the QMC model and may give way to more complex calculations involving neutron stars.

\section{Budget}

This project will cost $\approx$ \$1,000,000 including free flights to Japan purely for conferences *wink*.

We will not be submitting an application to a funding agency for support of this project. We will also not be contingent on funding support from elsewhere

\section{Research plan and timeline}

See attached chart for research plan timeline.

\section{Skills training and professional development}

During the research period, development will be undertaken via the a number of methods including but not limited to the following: Presenting research or other projects in department as research talks. The attendance of research talks given by researchers both in and out of the department. This includes talks directly relevant to the candidates research as well as talks outside of the candidates field.

CARST workshops and presentations will be undertaken to increase exposure to a wide variety of talks for a multitude of diverse topics. The attendance of the Postgraduate Symposium will also be undertaken as well as the schools research day. Other development will be conducted via online courses and the personal dedication of the candidate to broaden the acquired knowledge.

\section{Other requirements}

The proper ethics and research integrity required for the School of Physical Sciences will be undertaken by the candidate.
