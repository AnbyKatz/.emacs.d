\section{Relativistic Nuclear Field Theory}
\subsection{Uncharged and Charged Scalar Fields}
Consider the simplest example of a field ie the uncharged scalar field which we will denote $\sigma(x)$. This will have the corresponding KG Lagrangian density.
\[\mathcal{L}_\sigma=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \sigma\partial^\mu \sigma - m_\sigma^2\sigma^2)\]
where $m_\sigma$ denotes the meson mass. Clearly after applying the EL equations we get the corresponding KG equation for a free spin-zero meson ie
\[\partial_\mu\bigg(\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu\sigma)}\bigg)-\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\sigma}=0 \]
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{\Lag}{(\partial_\mu\sigma)}&=\pdv{(\partial_\mu\sigma)}\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\sigma g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu\sigma)\\
                                  &=\frac{1}{2}\bigg(g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu\sigma+\partial_\mu\sigma g^{\mu\nu}\frac{\partial_\nu\sigma}{\partial_\mu\sigma}\bigg)\\
                                  &=\frac{1}{2}\bigg(\partial^\mu\sigma+\partial_\nu\sigma g^{\mu\nu} \bigg)=\partial^\mu\sigma
\end{align*}
\[\implies \partial_\mu(\partial^\mu \sigma)+m_\sigma^2\sigma=0 \]
\[\therefore (\square+m_\sigma^2)\sigma(x)=0\]
where $\square\equiv\partial_\mu\partial^\mu$. We make the standard substitutions  for energy and momentum operators
\[E\to i\pdv{t} \qquad \mathbf{P}\to-i\grad\]
Note the KG equation represents the operator equation below when acted on a state
\[E^2=P^2+m_\sigma^2\]
and we recognise that the above Lagrangian has the same space symmetries of any Lorentz scalar Lagrangian and hence its energy momentum tensor takes the usual form
\[\mathcal{T}^{\mu\nu}\equiv\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial{(\partial_\mu\phi)}}\partial^\nu\phi-\eta^{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L}\]
A scalar Lagrangian that does have an internal symmetry is one representing two scalar mesons of the same mass,
\[\mathcal{L}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \sigma_1\partial^\mu \sigma_1 - m_\sigma^2\sigma_1^2)+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \sigma_2\partial^\mu \sigma_2 - m_\sigma^2\sigma_2^2)\]
This symmetry becomes more apparent if we define the complex field $\sigma=(\sigma_1+i\sigma_2)/\sqrt(2)$. Which then implies that we can write the lagrangian in the following way
\[\mathcal{L}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)=\partial_\mu\sigma^*\partial^\mu\sigma-m^2_\sigma\sigma^*\sigma\]
which is clearly invariant under the transformation $\sigma(x)\to e^{iq\lambda}\sigma(x)$ and $\sigma^*(x)\to e^{-iq\lambda}\sigma^*(x)$ where $\lambda$ is a cts variable and we interpret $q$ as the charge of the field. If we now want to construct the conserved current we consider the variational derivative of this above transformation $\delta\sigma=iq\lambda\sigma$ or in terms of the original field $\sigma_1\to\sigma_1-q\lambda\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_2\to\sigma_2+a\lambda\sigma_1$. Hence our small deformations of the field are $-q\sigma_2$ and $q\sigma_1$ which leads to a conserved current which is just the sum of two terms
\[J^\mu=q \bigg(\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu\sigma_1)}\sigma_2+\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu\sigma_2)}\sigma_1\bigg)=q(\sigma_1\partial^\mu\sigma_2+\sigma_2\partial^\mu\sigma_1)=q(\sigmav\cp\partial^\mu\sigmav) \]
or in terms of the complex field we have 
\[J^\mu=-iq(\sigma^*\partial^*\sigma-\sigma\partial_\mu\sigma^*)\]
\subsection{Uncharged and charged vector fields}
Now we'll consider the uncharged Lorentz vector field for a meson of mass $m_\omega$ and its corresponding tensor $ \omega_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu\omega_\nu-\partial_\nu\omega_\mu$ as analogous to EM theory. Which then gives the Lagrangian density
\[\mathcal{L}_\omega=-\frac{1}{4}\omega_{\mu\nu}\omega^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}m_\omega^2\omega_\mu\omega^\mu \] 
Which then gives if we apply the EL equations
\begin{align*} \frac{\partial\Lag}{\partial(\partial_\alpha\omega_{\beta})}&=-\frac{1}{4}g^{\mu\mu'}g^{\nu\nu'}\pdv{(\pd_\alpha\omega_\beta)}\omega_{\mu\nu}\omega_{\mu'\nu'}  \\
                                                                          &= -\frac{1}{4}g^{\mu\mu'}g^{\nu\nu'}\Big(\omega_{\mu'\nu'}(\delta^\alpha_\mu\delta^\beta_\nu-\delta^\alpha_\nu\delta^\beta_\mu)+\omega_{\mu\nu}(\delta^\alpha_{\mu'}\delta^\beta_{\nu'}-\delta^\alpha_{\nu'}\delta^\beta_{\mu'})\Big) \\
                                                                          &= -\frac{1}{4}(\omega^{\alpha\beta}-\omega^{\beta\alpha}+\omega^{\alpha\beta}-\omega^{\beta\alpha})\\
                                                                          &=\omega^{\beta\alpha}
\end{align*}
where we are free to change the final labels.
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{\Lag}{\omega_\mu}&=\frac{1}{2}m_\omega^2g^{\mu\mu'}\pdv{\omega_\mu}\omega_\mu\omega_{\mu'} \\
                        &=\frac{1}{2}m_\omega^2(\omega^\mu+g^{\mu\mu'}\omega_\mu\delta^{\mu}_{\mu'})\\
                        &=m^2_\omega\omega^\mu
\end{align*}
Hence finally we have that
\[\pd_\alpha\Big(\pdv{\Lag}{(\pd_\alpha\omega_\beta)}\Big)-\pdv{\Lag}{\omega_\beta}=0\]
\[\pd_\alpha(\pd^\beta\omega^\alpha-\pd^\alpha\omega^\beta)-m^2_\omega\omega^\beta=0\]
\[\implies \ \pd_\alpha\pd^\beta\omega^\alpha-(\square+m^2_\omega)\omega^\beta=0\]
Which may be equivalently written after relabeling and lowering of indices as
\[(\square+m_\omega^2)\omega_\mu-\partial_\mu\partial^\nu\omega_\nu=0\]
Which is known as the Proca equation. Taking the above equations divergence gives us
\[(\square+m_\omega^2)\partial^\mu\omega_\mu-\square\partial^\nu\omega_\nu=0\implies m_\omega^2\partial^\mu\omega_\mu=0\]
ie this implies that the field must be divergence-less if the particle (meson) it describes is massive. Hence for free mesons, each of the four lorentz components satisfy a KG equation of the form $(\square+m_\omega^2)\omega_\mu=0$. Finally we describe the charged meson triplet which we will denote $\vb{\rho}^\mu=(\rho_1^\mu,\rho_2^\mu,\rho_3^\mu)$. As expected the Lagrangian desity for the triplet is
\[\vb{\Lag}_\rho=-\frac{1}{4}\boldsymbol{\rho}_{\mu\nu}\cdot\boldsymbol{\rho}^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}m_\rho^2\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu\cdot\boldsymbol{\rho}^\mu\]
Which has the same phase invariance as our previous complex field if we introduce the the variable
\[\rho_\pm^\mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\rho_1^\mu\pm\rho_2^\mu)\]
Which then reproduce's the same invariance relations as our previous complex field. A more general invariant rotation in isospin space may be written in the form $\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu\to\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\times\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu$ where $\Lambda$ is an infinitesimal vector in isospin space. This may also be written using index notation as $\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu\to\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu+\epsilon_{ijk}\Lambda_j\rho_{k\mu}$. Going through similar working as previously done, this leads to a conserved current $\vb{I}^\nu=\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu\times\boldsymbol{\rho}^{\nu\mu}$. This is a Lorentz four current, the isospin current of the rho field. We can then easily obtain the charge current by just multiplying by the charge $q$
\[\mathcal{J}^\nu=q(\boldsymbol{\rho}_\mu\times\boldsymbol{\rho}^{\mu\nu})\]
Just as for the omega field, after applying the EL equations we arrive at another KG equation but for the $\rho$ field ie
\[(\square+m_\rho^2)\boldsymbol{\rho}^\mu=0\]
\subsection{Neutron and Proton}
Consider the neutron and proton which are both spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles so they both satisfy a Dirac equation. Take the Dirac Lagrangian describing both particles ie
\[\Lag=\psibar_p(i\slashed{\partial}-m)\psi_p+\psibar_n(i\slashed{\partial}-m)\psi_n\]
For convenience we introduce the notation
\[\psi\equiv\m{\psi_p\\\psi_n}\implies\Lag=\psibar(i\slashed{\partial}-m)\psi\]
let $\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3)$ denote the pauli matrices and $\Lambda$ an arbitrary vector constant in isospin space. This Lagrangian is then invariant under the cts phase transformation
\[\psi\to e^{-i\boldsymbol{\tau}\cdot\boldsymbol{\Lambda}/2}\psi\]
Clearly we can build up a finite rotation from infinitesimal ones. As before consider the variational derivative of $\psi$
\[\delta\psi=-\frac{i}{2}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau}\psi=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\cdot\vb{F}\]
Where $\vb{F}=-\frac{i}{2}\boldsymbol{\tau}\psi$
\[\pdv{\Lag}{(\partial_\mu\psi)}=\pdv{(\partial_\mu\psi)}\bigg(\psibar i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi-m\psibar\psi\bigg)=\psibar i\gamma^\mu\]
We can calculate the Noether current via the formula
\[\vb{J}^\mu\equiv \pdv{\Lag}{(\pd_\mu\phi_i)}\vb{F}_i\]
where $\vb{F}_i$ is a continuous deformation of the field coming from transformations of the form
\[\phi'_i(x)=\phi_i+\lambda_jF_i^j[\phi_1(x),...,\phi_n(x)]  \]
hence our conserved current for this field deformation is
\[\vb{I}^\mu=(\psibar i\gamma^\mu)\Big(-\frac{i}{2}\boldsymbol{\tau}\psi\Big)=\frac{1}{2}\psibar\gamma^\mu\boldsymbol{\tau}\psi\]
where $\vb{I}$ is a conserved isospin current related to the Noether current $\vb{J}$ by a factor of $q$ i.e the charge. If we consider the third component of $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ or the Pauli matrix we get the following
\[I_3^\mu=\frac{1}{2}\psibar\gamma^\mu\tau_3\psi \qquad \tau_3=\m{1&0\\0&-1}  \]
\[\implies \ I_3^\mu=\frac{1}{2}\psi^\dagger \gamma^0 \tau_3 \psi=\frac{1}{2}(\psi_p^\dagger\psi_p-\psi^\dagger_n\psi_n) \]
\subsection{Electromagnetic Field}
We will now introduce an electromagnetic field via our standard free EM Lagrangian
\[\Lag_{EM}=-\frac{1}{4}A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\mu}\qquad A_{\mu\nu}\equiv \pd_\mu A_\nu-\pd_\nu A_\mu  \]
with our Lorentz 4-vector $A^\mu=(V,\vb{A})$ where $V$ is the electric scalar potential and $\vb{A}$ the magnetic vector potential. We add electromagnetic interactions via the gauge transformation $\pd^\mu\to\pd^\mu+iqA_\mu\equiv \mathcal{D}^\mu$. hence for our spinor field of the proton we introduce this transformation into the Lagrangian to get the following (note clearly the electromagnetic dynamics of the system don't effect the uncharged neutron)
\begin{align*}
  \Lag&=\psibar_p(i\gamma_\mu\mathcal{D}_\mu-m)\psi_p-\frac{1}{4}A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\nu} \\
      &=\psibar_p(i\slashed{\pd}-m)\psi_p-\frac{1}{4}A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\nu}-A_\mu J^\mu
\end{align*}                    
where $J^\mu\equiv-q\psibar_p\gamma_\mu A^\mu\psi_p$. Similarly for our complex scalar field we have after the gauge transformation that
\begin{align*}
  \Lag&=(\mathcal{D}^\mu\sigma)^\dagger(\mathcal{D}_\mu\sigma)-m\sigma^\dagger\sigma-\frac{1}{4}A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\nu}\\
      &=\Lag(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)-\frac{1}{4}A_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu\nu}+iqA_\mu(\sigma\pd^\mu\sigma^*-\sigma^*\pd^\mu\sigma)+q^2A^2\sigma^*\sigma
\end{align*}
We could also write this in terms of two fields and calculate our conserved current via a similar process as before. One finds that
\[J^\mu=-iq\Big(\sigma^*(\mathcal{D}^\mu\sigma)-\sigma(\mathcal{D}^\mu\sigma^*)\Big)\]
which is exactly what we expect i.e it looks like the Noether current under the transformation $\pd^\mu\to\mathcal{D}^\mu$. Note the quadratic coupling from the charge in the Lagrangian.
\subsection{The $\sigma$-$\omega$ Model}
Our nuclear field theory will be based on the fields of four particles: the nucleons, a scalar meson and the omega vector meson. We want the Lagrangian to be a Lorentz scalar. The most intuitive choice is having the scalar meson couple to the baryon scalar density $\psibar\psi$ and the vector meson couple to the baryon four current $\psibar\gamma^\mu\psi$. The interaction Lagrangian will hence be the sum of these couplings times some coupling strength i.e.
\[\Lag=g_\sigma\sigma(x)\psibar(x)\psi(x)-g_\omega\omega_\mu(x)\psibar(x)\gamma^\mu\psi(x)\]
where the choice of sign is arbitrary. Now adding all our Lagrangian's together to include the dynamics of the nucleons and the mesons gives us
      \begin{align*}
        \Lag= \ &\psibar\Big(i\gamma_\mu(\pd^\mu+ig_\omega\omega^\mu)-(m-g_\sigma\sigma)\Big)\psi\\
                &+\frac{1}{2}(\pd_\mu \sigma\pd^\mu \sigma-m_\sigma^2\sigma^2) -\frac{1}{4}\omega_{\mu\nu}\omega^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}m_\omega^2\omega_\mu\omega^\mu
      \end{align*}
Applying our previous knowledge of the Euler Lagrange equations with the added coupling terms gives us that
\[(\square+m_\omega^2)\omega_\mu(x)=g_\sigma\psibar(x)\psi(x)\]
\[(\square+m_\omega^2)\omega_\mu(x)-\pd_\mu\pd^\nu\omega_\nu(x)=g_\omega\psibar(x)\gamma_\mu\psi(x)\]
Nucleon conservation $\implies \pd^\nu\omega_\nu=0$ for the massive vector field. The Euler Lagrange equations for nucleons are
\[\Big(\gamma_\mu(\pd^\mu-g_\omega\omega^\mu(x))-(m-g_\sigma\sigma(x))\Big)\psi(x)=0\]
hence we have three coupled, non-linear differential equations i.e. the stuff of nightmares. This is where we introduce the ``relativistic mean-field approximation''. The system we are interested in is static uniform matter in the ground state so replacing the fields with their mean values in this state is justified, $\sigma\to\ev{\sigma}$ and $\omega_\mu\to\ev{\omega_\mu}$. In static uniform matter the source currents $\psibar\psi$ and $\psibar\gamma^\mu\psi$ are independent of $x$ and hence so are their mean fields. So our three Euler Lagrange equations reduce to
      \begin{align*}
        m_\sigma^2\sigma&=g\sigma\ev{\psibar\psi} \\
    m^2_\omega\omega_0&=g_\omega\ev{\psi^\dagger\psi} \\
        m^2_\omega\omega_k&=g_\omega\ev{\psibar\gamma_k\psi}
      \end{align*}
we may now write the meson fields without their $x$ dependence hence our Euler Lagrange equation for nucleons becomes
\[\Big(\gamma_\mu(\pd^\mu-g_\omega\omega^\mu)-(m-g_\sigma\sigma)\Big)\psi(x)=0\]
remembering that these are now the mean values of the fields not the fields themselves. The nucleon field hence satisfies an equation with no $x$ dependence, these fields are momentum eigen states which we can write as
\[\psi(x)=\psi(k)e^{-k\cdot x}\]
where $k\cdot x\equiv k_\mu x^\mu=k_0t-\kv\cdot\vb{r}$. We can then write our equation in momentum space as
\[\Big(\gamma_\mu(k^\mu-g_\omega\omega^\mu)-(m-g_\sigma\sigma)\Big)\psi(k)=0\]
remembering that the operator on the state is a matrix and $\psi(k)$ is an eight-component spinor. We wish to compare this to the Dirac equation so redefining our terms as:
\[K_\mu=k_\mu-g_\omega\omega_\mu \qquad m^*(\sigma)=m-g_\sigma\sigma\]
we call $m^*$ the effective mass of the Dirac effective mass. So rewriting our above equation gives us
\[(\slashed{K}-m^*)\psi(K)=0\]
The eigen-values may be found by applying the following trick on the above operator $(\slashed{K}-m^*)$, multiply both sides by $(\slashed{K}+m^*)$ hence
                            \begin{align*}
                              (\fsl{K}+m^*)(\fsl{K}-m^*)&=\fsl{K}\fsl{K}-(m^*)^2\\
    &=\gamma_\mu K^\mu\gamma_\nu K^\nu-(m^*)^2\\
    &= K^\mu K^\nu\frac{\gamma_\mu\gamma_\nu+\gamma_\nu\gamma_\mu}{2}-(m^*)^2\\
                                        &=K_\mu K^\mu-(m^*)^2
                            \end{align*}
Where above we used the anti-commutation relations. Hence our final Dirac equation is just
\[ \Big(K_\mu K^\mu-(m^*)^2\Big)\psi(K)=0\]
Our operator is now clearly a number, hence either the operator is 0 or the state is. For the case when the operator is 0 we have that
\[K^2=0\implies K_0^2-\abs{\vb{K}}^2-(m^*)^2=0\]
hence we get our mass on-shell relationship of $K_0=\sqrt{\abs{\vb{K}}+(m^*)^2}$. Denote the timelike component by $e(\vb{k})\equiv k_0(\vb{k})=K_0+g_\omega\omega_0$ and hence the nucleon eigenvalues for a particle with momentum $\vb{k}$ and antiparticle are
      \begin{align*}
        e(\vb{k})&=E(\vb{k})+g_\omega\omega_0\\
        \overline{e}(\vb{k})&=E(\vb{k})-g_\omega\omega_0
      \end{align*}
with
\[E(\vb{k})=K_0=\sqrt{(\vb{k}-g_\omega\boldsymbol{\omega})^2+(m-g_\sigma\sigma)^2}\]
So we have a form for the Dirac momentum eigenvalues expressed in terms of of the mean meson fields $\sigma$ and $\omega^\mu$. However we still want to solve the equations of motion which encodes the dynamics of the system. To do this we need the ground state expectation values, we can do this without constructing the dirac spinors themselves.

We characterize a single-nucleon state by the momentum $\vb{k}$ and the spin and isospin projection which we denote together by $\kappa$. Clearly for the proton and neutron we  have one of two spin projections $\pm 1/2$. Denote by a round bracket the expectation value of an operator in a single-particle state, $(\psibar \Gamma \psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}$. The expectation value of an operator in the ground state of the many-nucleon system is hence.

\begin{align*}
  \ev{\psibar\Gamma\psi}=\sum_{\kappa}\int\frac{\dd\vb{k}}{(\pi)^3}(\psibar\Gamma\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}\Theta[\mu-e(\vb{k})]
\end{align*}
Where $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function, $\kappa$ sums over the spin-isospin states of the occupied momentum states. $\mu$ is the Fermi energy or the chemical potential. We denote the Fermi surface by the case when $e(\vb{k})=\mu$, this is taken in spherical momentum space.

To analyze the operator $\Gamma$ we consider the Dirac Hamiltonian in momentum space by analyzing our previous equation

\begin{align*}
  \Big(\gamma_\mu(k^\mu-g_\omega\omega^\mu)-(m-g_\sigma\sigma)\Big)\psi&=0\\
\Big(\gamma_0k^0-\bsym{\gamma}\cdot\vb{k}-g_\omega\gamma_\mu\omega^\mu-m^*\Big)\psi&=0\\
     \Big(k_0-\gamma_0(\bsym{\gamma}\cdot\vb{k}+g_\omega\gamma_\mu\omega^\mu+m^*)\Big)\psi&=0
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  \implies k_0\psi=\gamma_0(\bsym{\gamma}\cdot\vb{k}+g_\omega\gamma_\mu\omega^\mu+m^*)\psi
\end{align*}
and $k_0=E$ hence we have an equation of the form $E\psi=H_D\psi$ where
\begin{align*}
  H_D=\gamma_0(\bsym{\gamma}\cdot\vb{k}+g_\omega\gamma_\mu\omega^\mu+m^*)
\end{align*}
Taking the expectation value of a single nucleon momentum state as defined previously gives us that.
\begin{align*}
  (\psi^\dagger H_D\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}=K_0(\vb{k})=E(\vb{k})+g_\omega\omega_0
\end{align*}
where this comes from the eigen value of our Dirac equation for this operator for a particle. It is worth noting that the right hand side of this equation is independent of the spin label $\kappa$.

Consider taking the derivative of the left hand side of the above equation with respect to any variable $\zeta$ in the Hamiltonian:
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{\zeta}(\psi^\dagger H_D\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}=\Big(\psi^\dg\pdv{H_D}{\zeta}\psi\Big)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}+k_0(\vb{k})\pdv{\zeta}(\psi^\dg\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}
\end{align*}
Remembering that $\psi(\vb{k})$ is an eigen function gives us that tells us that only the first term survives above as we set a normalisation for the second term which dies. Consider letting $\zeta=\omega_0$, by our previous calculations we would have that.
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{\zeta}(\psi^\dagger H_D\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}=g_{\omega} \qquad \pdv{H_D}{\omega_0}=g_{\omega}\gamma_0\gamma_0=g_\omega
\end{align*}
hence we have that
\begin{align*}
  g_{\omega}=g_\omega\qty(\psi^\dg\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}\implies (\psi^\dg\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}=1
\end{align*}
so our baryon current density hence becomes
\begin{align*}
  \rho&=\ev{\psi^\dg\psi}\\
      &=4\int_0^{\vb{k}}\frac{\dd\vb{k}}{(2\pi)^3}\\
      &=\frac{4}{(2\pi)^3}\int\dd\Omega\int_0^{\vb{k}}\dd k \ k^2\\
      &=\frac{16\pi k^3}{3\cdot 8\pi^3}\\
      &=\frac{2k^3}{3\pi^2}
\end{align*}
Where we have used that
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^k\dd\vb{k}&=\int_0^k\dd k\ k^2\int_{-1}^{+1}\dd(\cos\theta)\int_0^{2\pi}\dd\phi\\
  &\equiv\int_0^k\dd k\ k^2\int\dd\Omega
\end{align*}
This is known as the vector density, next we calculate the scalar density. The vector density is the Lorentz time component of the conserved baryon current $j^\mu=\psibar\gamma^\mu\psi$ and is simply the baryon density. To get the scalar density we take the derivative with respect to $m$
\begin{align*}
  (\psibar\psi)_{\vb{k}_\kappa}&=\pdv{E(k)}{m}\\
                               &=\frac{1}{2}(k^2+(m-g_\sigma\sigma)^2)^{-1/2}2(m-g_\sigma\sigma)\\
                               &=\frac{m-g_\sigma\sigma}{\sqrt{k^2+(m-g_\sigma\sigma)^2}}
\end{align*}
hence
\begin{align*}
  \rho_s\equiv\ev{\psibar\psi}=\frac{2}{\pi^2}\int_0^k\dd k\ k^2\frac{m-g_\sigma\sigma}{\sqrt{k^2+(m-g_\sigma\sigma)^2}}
\end{align*}
This gives us the equations of motion without having to construct the Dirac spinors from the Dirac Hamiltonian.
\begin{align*}
  g_\sigma\sigma&=\qty(\frac{g_\sigma}{m_\sigma})^2\frac{2}{\pi^2}\int_0^k\dd k\ k^2\frac{m-g_\sigma\sigma}{\sqrt{k^2+(m-g_\sigma\sigma)^2}}\\
  g_\omega\omega_0&=\qty(\frac{g_\omega}{m_\omega})^2\rho\\
  m_\omega^2\omega_k&=0
\end{align*}
We can see that the solutions only depend on the ratios $g_\sigma/m$ and not the value of the coupling constants themselves. This is true in general for infinite nuclear matter. For finite nuclei the equations will depend on the coupling constants.

We can look at the behaviour of $g_\sigma\sigma$ at low nucleon density where $k$ is small, the integral is small and tends to zero. At high densities we want the equation of motion to be of the form $g_\sigma\sigma=m-\delta$, substituting this in gives us

\begin{align*}
  g_\sigma\sigma=\qty(\frac{g_\sigma}{m_\sigma})^2\frac{2}{\pi^2}\int_0^k\dd k\ k^2\frac{\delta}{\sqrt{k^2+\delta^2}}
\end{align*}
and $\delta$ is small so only keep terms linear in $\delta$ hence
\begin{align*}
  g_\sigma\sigma&\to\qty(\frac{g_\sigma}{m_\sigma})^2\frac{2}{\pi^2}\int_0^k\dd k\ k^2\frac{\delta}{k}\\
                &=\qty(\frac{g_\sigma}{m_\sigma})^2\frac{2}{\pi^2}\frac{1}{2}k^2\delta\\
                &=\qty(\frac{g_\sigma k}{m_\sigma\pi})^2\delta
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  \delta&=m-g_\sigma\sigma\\
        &=m-\delta\qty(\frac{g_\sigma k}{m_\sigma\pi})^2\\
  \implies \ \delta&=\frac{m}{1+(g_\sigma k/m_\sigma\pi)^2}k
\end{align*}
hence
\begin{align*}
  g_\sigma\sigma&\to m-\frac{m}{1+(g_\sigma k/m_\sigma\pi)^2}\\
                &=m\qty(\frac{g_\sigma k}{m_\sigma\pi})^2\qty[1+\qty(\frac{g_\sigma k}{m_\sigma\pi})^2]^{-1}
\end{align*}
in the high density limit
