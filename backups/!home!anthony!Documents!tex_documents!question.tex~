\underline{1:} For the case of the vector meson field $\omega_\mu$. Glendenning stated that because of nucleon conservation (the divergence-less of the baryon current), we have that $\pd^\mu\omega_\mu=0$ for the massive vector field. I was curious if this then implies that there are no point sources of vector meson fields analogous to EM where $\grad\cdot\vb{B}=0$ implies as such
